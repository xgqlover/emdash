# Developer flows

The index of every first-class developer flow, one blessed command each.
Conventions that apply throughout:

- **One blessed command per flow.** Aliases that duplicated a flow (`d`,
  `db:setup`, `run:docker-ssh`) no longer exist.
- **Root vs app dir:** run workspace-wide flows from the repo root, app-scoped
  flows from `apps/emdash-desktop/`, package-local flows from that package.
- **Environment preflight is owned by the doctor.** When a flow lists a
  prerequisite, the check for it is `pnpm run doctor` (root) — report-only,
  every failing line names the fixing command.
- **Build ordering is wired, not documented.** Flows that bypass Nx task
  orchestration (app-only dev, Storybook) start with
  `tooling/scripts/ensure-packages-built.mjs`, which builds the workspace
  packages through Nx and no-ops when the flow is already running as an Nx
  task. Both orderings are verified to work on a fresh clone that never built
  anything; warm re-runs are Nx cache hits and cost about a second.

## Setup

| Flow | Command | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Bootstrap | `pnpm install` | root |
| Environment health | `pnpm run doctor` | root |

`pnpm install` is the whole setup: any pnpm on PATH provisions the pinned pnpm
and Node itself (see [quickstart](../quickstart.md)), installs dependencies,
builds the isolated system-Node better-sqlite3 side project, and rebuilds the
app's better-sqlite3 for the Electron ABI. Playwright browsers for the app's
browser test project are the one extra step, only needed for tests:
`pnpm exec playwright install` (the doctor checks it).

## Development

| Flow | Command | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full workspace dev | `pnpm run dev` | root |
| App-only dev | `pnpm run dev` | `apps/emdash-desktop/` |
| App dev, verbose Vite logs | `pnpm run dev:debug` | `apps/emdash-desktop/` |
| Main-only / renderer-only watch | `pnpm run dev:main` / `pnpm run dev:renderer` | `apps/emdash-desktop/` |
| One package in isolation | `pnpm run dev` | that `packages/*` dir |
| Storybook (ui) | `pnpm --filter @emdash/ui run storybook` (port 6006) | root |
| Storybook (chat-ui) | `pnpm --filter @emdash/chat-ui run storybook` (port 6007) | root |
| Theme codegen | `pnpm run build:theme` / `pnpm run watch:theme` | `packages/theme/` |

Notes:

- App dev scripts hardcode `LOG_LEVEL=debug` and write the main-process log to
  `apps/emdash-desktop/.emdash-logs/emdash.log`.
- Root `pnpm run dev` already includes every package watcher; the per-package
  watch flow is only for working on one package in isolation.
- Nx starts a background daemon that lingers after dev sessions; stop it with
  `pnpm exec nx daemon --stop` if task results ever look stale (the doctor
  reports a running daemon).
- Theme codegen normally runs as an Nx build dependency; invoke it manually
  only when iterating on the token codegen itself.

## Database

| Flow | Command | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Generate a migration | `pnpm run db:generate <schema>` | `apps/emdash-desktop/` |
| Regenerate fixture DBs | `pnpm run db:fixtures` | `apps/emdash-desktop/` |
| Validate migrations | `pnpm run test:migrations` | `apps/emdash-desktop/` |
| Reset dev databases | `pnpm run db:reset` | `apps/emdash-desktop/` |

The `db:generate` dispatcher covers all five Drizzle schemas in the repo and
prints the follow-up obligations (fixtures, migration tests) after generating:

| Schema | Owner | Migrations directory |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `app` | `apps/emdash-desktop` | `apps/emdash-desktop/drizzle/` |
| `automations` | `packages/core` | `packages/core/src/runtimes/automations/node/persistence/migrations/` |
| `conversations` | `packages/core` | `packages/core/src/runtimes/conversations/node/persistence/migrations/` |
| `file-search` | `packages/core` | `packages/core/src/runtimes/file-search/node/storage/migrations/` |
| `workspace-registry` | `packages/core` | `packages/core/src/runtimes/workspace-registry/node/persistence/migrations/` |

`db:reset` honors `EMDASH_DB_FILE`: when set it deletes that database family
(main file plus the derived `-file-search` / `-automations` / `-operations`
siblings and SQLite `-wal`/`-shm` sidecars); otherwise it deletes the default
dev databases in the platform user-data dir. Use `EMDASH_DB_FILE` isolation for
schema work: `EMDASH_DB_FILE=/tmp/emdash-scratch.db pnpm run dev`.

## Checks and tests

| Flow | Command | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Full merge gate | `pnpm run check` | root |
| Individual gates | `pnpm run format` / `lint` / `typecheck` / `test` | root |
| One package's tests | `pnpm test` | that app or package directory |
| One package's tests from root | `pnpm --filter @emdash/plugins test` | root |
| CI-style scoping | `pnpm run affected` | root |
| One app Vitest project | `pnpm test -- --project <name>` | `apps/emdash-desktop/` |
| Plugin tests in watch mode | `pnpm run test:watch` | `packages/plugins/` |
| chat-ui perf / bench | `pnpm run test:perf` / `pnpm run test:bench` | `packages/chat-ui/` |
| Remote WSS integration test | `pnpm run test:workspace-server-remote` | `apps/emdash-desktop/` |

- `pnpm run check` runs the four gate commands in order and is exactly
  equivalent to running them by hand.
- Root, package-local, and filtered test commands use the same Nx targets and
  prepare required builds automatically. Selecting a package does not run its
  dependencies' tests. Arguments after `test --`, such as a test-file path or
  `--project`, go to Vitest rather than Nx. Use pnpm's `--filter` before `test`
  to select packages.
- App Vitest projects: `node`, `main-db`, `fixtures`, `migrations`, `scripts`,
  `browser`. The browser project needs Playwright browsers — run the doctor.
- CI (`code-consistency-check.yml`) gates `format:check`, `typecheck`, `lint`,
  and `test` via `nx affected`. The Playwright-backed `browser` projects (app
  and chat-ui) are skipped when Vitest detects CI until browser provisioning is
  proven stable there.
- The remote WSS test requires Docker and the workspace-server stack
  (`pnpm run run:docker-remote` from `apps/workspace-server/`) and sets
  `EMDASH_TEST_REMOTE_WSS=1` itself. Run the doctor first; it reports Docker
  reachability.

## Remote development

| Flow | Command | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Workspace-server dev | `pnpm run dev` / `dev:remote` / `dev:remote-app` | `apps/workspace-server/` |
| Docker remote stack | `pnpm run run:docker-remote` | `apps/workspace-server/` |

The workspace-server stack is the only remote-dev stack. Prerequisite: Docker
running (doctor reports it). See
[remote development](remote-development.md) for the full workflow and the
`EMDASH_WS_*` env family.

## Packaging and maintenance

| Flow | Command | Where |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Local packaging | `pnpm run package` / `package:mac` / `package:linux` / `package:win` | `apps/emdash-desktop/` |
| Rebuild native deps | `pnpm run rebuild` | `apps/emdash-desktop/` |
| Lint-infra allowlists | `pnpm run prune:boundary-allowlists` | root |
| Task graph | `pnpm run graph` | root |
| Releases (maintainers) | `gh workflow run release-prod.yml` / `release-canary.yml` / `release-workspace-server.yml` | — |

- Local packaging without signing identities still produces installable
  artifacts; mac builds are unsigned/un-notarized and Gatekeeper will warn.
- Linux packaging keeps `extraMetadata.desktopName` aligned with the installed
  `.desktop` filename via `linux.syncDesktopName`. The desktop IDs are `Emdash`
  (stable) and `emdash-canary` (canary); preserve them across upgrades for dock pins.
  Electron 40 uses this metadata for Wayland's `app_id`, but uses the product name
  for X11's `WM_CLASS`, so `linux.desktop.entry.StartupWMClass` remains the product
  name. Release version overrides must merge `extraMetadata`, not replace it.
  The release script tests check both channels' generated desktop entries and
  package metadata. Before shipping changes here, verify dock grouping and icons
  in GNOME with native Wayland and XWayland, including stable and canary together.
- `rebuild` force-rebuilds better-sqlite3 for the installed Electron version
  (auto-detected). node-pty is never rebuilt — its N-API prebuild serves both
  runtimes. Offline fallback: append `--build-from-source`.
- Run `prune:boundary-allowlists` after fixing boundary violations; root lint
  fails while the allowlists carry stale entries. The allowlists are
  shrink-only — the script removes entries that no longer violate and never
  adds new ones.
- Releases are maintainer-only and run only when explicitly asked
  (see AGENTS.md guardrails).

## Escape hatches

Environment variables that intentionally deviate from the default setup. The
doctor lists any that are active.

| Variable | Effect |
| --- | --- |
| `EMDASH_DB_FILE` | Point the app (and `db:reset`) at an isolated database file |
| `EMDASH_SKIP_ELECTRON_REBUILD=1` | Skip the Electron-ABI rebuild in postinstall (CI sets this implicitly via `--ignore-scripts`) |
| `EMDASH_DISABLE_NATIVE_DB=1` | Run without the native better-sqlite3 (also skips its rebuild) |
| `EMDASH_DISABLE_PTY=1` | Run without PTY support |
| `EMDASH_TEST_SKIP_BROWSER=1` | Omit the Playwright-backed `browser` Vitest projects locally |
| `EMDASH_FORCE_BOOT_FAILURE=1` | Force the boot-failure path for recovery testing |
| `TELEMETRY_ENABLED=false` | Disable telemetry |
| `CODEX_SANDBOX_MODE`, `CODEX_APPROVAL_POLICY` | Override Codex provider sandbox/approval behavior |
